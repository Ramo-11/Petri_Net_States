1- Calculate Inciden matrix B:
B = B_plus - B_minus

2- Find all firing transitions from the marking state
the first marking is M_0

3- assign x1, x2, ..., xn corresponding to the firing transitions

4- Find all marking states that branch off M_0 
Do the calculations for all transitions that are equal to true by passing the correct x

5- reset all the transitoins to false, and repeat steps starting from step 2 by changing the marked state
