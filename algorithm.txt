1- Calculate Inciden matrix B:
B = B_plus - B_minus

2- Calculate controller incident matrix 
B_controller = -LB

3- Find incident of the entire petri by adding B and B_controller to one matrix
B_controller += B

4- Find petri net initial marking
M_C_0 = b - LM

5- Find initial marking of the entire petri net by adding M0 and M_C_0 to one matrix
M_C_0 += M0

6- Find all firing transitions from M_C_0

7- assign x1, x2, ..., xn corresponding to the firing transitions

8- Find all marking states that branch off M_C_0 
Do the calculations for all transitions that are equal to true by passing the correct x

9- reset all the transitoins, and repeat steps starting from step 6 by changing the marked state
